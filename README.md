# Spotify Songs Project Data Analysis

## Project Overview

### Goal
The primary objective of the Spotify Songs Project Data Analysis is to perform an in-depth examination of the `songs.db` SQLite database. This database contains comprehensive information about songs and their corresponding artists, specifically focusing on the top 100 streamed songs on Spotify during the year 2018. By formulating and executing SQL queries, the project aims to derive valuable insights and solutions to a diverse array of questions centered around the songs and artists present within the dataset.

### Implementation
The project is executed through the utilization of SQLite, a robust and widely-used relational database management system. The interaction with the `songs.db` database occurs via the terminal, where SQL queries are crafted and subsequently executed. The scope of the queries encompasses a wide spectrum of tasks, including but not limited to, listing song names, arranging songs by various attributes, computing average values, and pinpointing songs created by specific artists.

### Key Metrics
Through the judicious application of SQL queries, several pivotal metrics and insights are unearthed:

1. **Song Attributes:** The queries unearth crucial details concerning attributes such as tempo, duration, energy, danceability, and valence for each song.
2. **Artist Information:** Insights into artists and their contributions to individual songs are illuminated.
3. **Song Popularity:** The analysis identifies the longest songs, high-energy songs, and those that feature collaborations with other artists.
4. **Average Metrics:** By employing aggregations, the average energy across all songs as well as for songs associated with specific artists is computed.
5. **User Preferences:** The analysis offers a glimpse into user preferences by assessing metrics like danceability, energy, and valence.

## Acknowledgment

Through the execution of this data analysis venture, I aspire to unravel a deeper comprehension of the musical trends and listener inclinations that underlie Spotify's annual campaigns. Ultimately, this pursuit seeks to elevate the musical experience for enthusiasts spanning the globe.
